"""Graphical interface components for MKV Cleaner.

This package defines the custom windows, widgets and logic mixins
used by the application:

Windows
    ``MainWindow`` hosts the core interface while
    ``SubtitlePreviewWindow`` displays subtitles in a popup.

Widgets
    Toolbar and table classes such as ``GroupBar``, ``ActionBar``,
    ``TrackTable`` and ``FileList`` plus delegates and helpers like
    ``LogoSplash``.

Logic mixins
    ``SettingsLogic``, ``GroupLogic``, ``TableLogic``, ``ActionsLogic``
    and ``ShortcutLogic`` provide reusable behaviour combined in
    ``MainWindow``.
